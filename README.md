# Backoff for Node.js [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/MathieuTurcotte/node-backoff.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/MathieuTurcotte/node-backoff)

Fibonacci and exponential backoffs for Node.js.

## Installation

```
npm install backoff
```
## Usage

In order to use backoff, require `backoff`.

```js
var backoff = require('backoff');
```

The usual way to instantiate a new `Backoff` object is to use one predefined
factory method: `backoff.fibonacci([options])`, `backoff.exponential([options])`.

`Backoff` inherits from `EventEmitter`. One can listen for backoff completion
by listening for `backoff` events. Registered handlers will be called with the
current backoff number and delay.

``` js
var fibonacciBackoff = backoff.fibonacci({
    initialDelay: 10,
    maxDelay: 1000
});

fibonacciBackoff.on('backoff', function(number, delay) {
    console.log(number + ' ' + delay + 'ms');

    if (number < 15) {
        fibonacciBackoff.backoff();
    }
});

fibonacciBackoff.backoff();
```

The previous example would print:

```
0 10ms
1 10ms
2 20ms
3 30ms
4 50ms
5 80ms
6 130ms
7 210ms
8 340ms
9 550ms
10 890ms
11 1000ms
12 1000ms
13 1000ms
14 1000ms
15 1000ms
```

Backoff objects are meant to be instantiated once and reused several times
by calling `reset` after each successful backoff operation.

## API

### backoff.exponential([options])

Constructs an exponential backoff (10, 20, 40, 80, etc.).

`options` is an object with the following defaults:

```js
options = {
    randomisationFactor: 0,
    initialDelay: 100,
    maxDelay: 10000
};
```

With these values, the backoff delay will increase from 100ms to 10000ms. The
randomisation factor controls the range of randomness and must be between 0
and 1. By default, no randomisation is applied on the backoff delay.

### backoff.fibonacci([options])

Constructs a Fibonacci backoff (10, 10, 20, 30, 50, etc.).

The Fibonacci backoff has the same set of options as the exponential backoff.

### Class Backoff

#### new Backoff(strategy)

- strategy: the backoff strategy to use

Constructs a new backoff object from a specific backoff strategy. The backoff
strategy must implement the `BackoffStrategy`interface defined bellow.

#### backoff.backoff()

Starts a backoff operation. Will throw an error if a backoff operation is
already in progress.

In practice, this method should be called after a failed attempt to perform a
sensitive operation (connecting to a database, downloading a resource over the
network, etc.).

#### backoff.reset()

Resets the backoff delay to the initial backoff delay and stop any backoff
operation in progress. After reset, a backoff instance can and should be
reused.

In practice, this method should be called after having successfully completed
the sensitive operation guarded by the backoff instance or if the client code
request to stop any reconnection attempt.

#### Event: 'backoff'

- number: number of backoff since last reset
- delay: current backoff delay

Emitted on backoff completion, effectively signaling that the failing operation
should be retried.

#### Event: 'next'

- number: number of next backoff.
- delay: time until next backoff event.

Emitted when a backoff is queued. signals how long until the 'backoff' event 
will be emitted.

### Interface BackoffStrategy

A backoff strategy must provide the following methods.

#### strategy.next()

Computes and returns the next backoff delay.

#### strategy.reset()

Resets the backoff delay to its initial value.

### Class ExponentialStrategy

Exponential (10, 20, 40, 80, etc.) backoff strategy implementation.

#### new ExponentialStrategy([options])

The options are:

- randomisationFactor: defaults to 0, must be between 0 and 1
- initialDelay: defaults to 100 ms
- maxDelay: defaults to 10000 ms

### Class FibonacciStrategy

Fibonnaci (10, 10, 20, 30, 50, etc.) backoff strategy implementation.

#### new FibonacciStrategy([options])

The options are:

- randomisationFactor: defaults to 0, must be between 0 and 1
- initialDelay: defaults to 100 ms
- maxDelay: defaults to 10000 ms
